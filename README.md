# TAP_CONTROLED_LED
To control three LEDs (Red, Green, and Blue) using a touch sensor. Based on the number of taps (1, 2, or 3), a specific LED turns on, the buzzer beeps twice, and the current state is shown on a 16x2 I2C LCD.
# ðŸ‘† Tap-Controlled LED System (Arduino UNO)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a tap-sensitive LED control system using Arduino UNO and a vibration or piezo sensor. It allows users to toggle LED states with simple physical taps, making it ideal for touchless or gesture-based interfaces. The repository includes source code, documentation, pin mapping, and circuit visuals for easy replication and understanding.

## Tech Stack
- Arduino UNO (`TAP_CONTROLLED_LED_SYSTEM.img`)
- Vibration or piezo sensor
- LED output module
- Excel for pin configuration
- Word documentation for system overview

## Files Included
- `TAP_CONTROLLED_LED_SYSTEM.img`: Arduino sketch for tap detection and LED control
- `TAP_CONTROLLED_LED_SYSTEM.docx`: Detailed documentation of system design and operation
- `TAP_CONTROLLED_LED_SYSTEM_PIN_OUT.xlsx`: Pin configuration and hardware mapping
- `tap_controlled_led_system.image.jpg`: Photo of the physical setup
- `circuit_image (8).png`: Circuit diagram
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Highlights
- Tap-based LED control using vibration sensing
- Toggle logic for switching LED states with each tap
- Modular code structure for easy customization
- Clear documentation and pin mapping for reproducibility
- Visual assets for hardware setup and circuit layout

## How It Works
- The sensor detects physical taps and sends a signal to the Arduino
- Arduino processes the input and toggles the LED state
- Circuit and pin mapping ensure accurate signal flow and control
